# InguinalHernia_RoboticCost

Evaluating the Trends in Cost of Robotic Inguinal Hernai as comapred to the Open and Laproscopic techniques. 

This analysis is focused on th eOutpatient Inguinal Hernina in the state of Florida. Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, outpatient discharge data was linked with CMS Cost reports data to anlayze the trends in cost (cost data was adjusted for inflation) of robotic inguinal hernia.

All the data cleaning and preperation was performed in STATA, whereas trend modeling was performed using R Studio.

Access to FL AHCA is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization by the Florida Agency of Health Care Administration, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes. (CMS Cost reporst data is publicly available)

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, pre processing, and modeling has been shared.
